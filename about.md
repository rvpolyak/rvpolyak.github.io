My curiosities lie in business, business cultures, what makes great leaders, the dynamics of people, the power of self improvement, reading good books and expanding my knowledge.

I am fascinated by the likes of Larry Eillison and Steve Jobs who in their ruthless pursuit and often barbaric ways use their brilliance to create amazing things.

Google rules in my world! How amazing is it to see such a large and successful business focus on their employees as much as their products and how their products are making our lives easier.

I am following my passions, unlocking my potential, finding answers and pushing myself through all the chaos of the world to live my true authentic self.
