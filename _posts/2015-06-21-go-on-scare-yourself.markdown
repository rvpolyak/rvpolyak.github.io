I have always dreamed of being a successful athlete, blogger, writer and business women.

Currently I am a successful dreamer.

I know to be successful hard work is a must! I have never been afraid of hard work, what I am afraid of is failure and not being good enough. I have allowed the little voice in my head tell me that I will never make it, you are not a fast enough, you don’t write well enough, you just don’t know enough.

All of the above is true, because I let myself believe that, today that stopped.

I woke up at 4:00am, went to the gym to get fit and healthy.

I gave advice at work today without consulting my manager, I was confident in the advice and my ability to give it.

I hit the publish button on this my first blog post.

Today I did things that scared me, I did worry I would be slow and out of shape, yes I worried that the advice I gave was aggressive opening the door to possible liability and yes I am scared that people I know will read this and offer their opinion, but it feels good to finally stop dreaming and taking action.

Go on do something that scares you, it may not be today or tomorrow, but push yourself, get uncomfortable, hit the publish button and feel the satisfaction in trumping your fear.
